Step 1. Telgram
===============

Now we will create a bot, invite it to a Telegram group, and set ut up for messaging. Also, we will get the API key necesary to use the bot.

1.1 Create the bot
------------------

Once inside Telegram app, we will use the search bar to look for botFather, it will probably be the firt result,
but we can double check by looking at the verified icon next to the botFather name.
We click the chat, select start button, and type the /newbot command.

for now just save your bot link, and the HTTP API key.

---------------------------------------

Now, you need to create a new Telegram group, and when you are asked to add members, just type the name of the bot
you just created.
